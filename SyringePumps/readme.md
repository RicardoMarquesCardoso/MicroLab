# Syringe Pump

### Introduction

The goal is to develop a low-cost, easy to build syringe pump suitable for the operation of microfluidic devices. This solution is heavily influenced by the one presented by [DropletKitchen](https://github.com/DropletKitchen/pumpsn17). 

The developed syringe pumps tries to introduce two main features to the other available noncommercial solutions:

* Dispense two syringes with a single device;
* Possibility to operate in the vertical position;

Step resolution : 0.04 nm/µstep
Size : 7cm x 7cm x 30cm
Price : 110 €

### Materials and tools

Besides all required [materials](#bill-of-materials), to replicate this project you will need access to a: 

* Laser Cutter machine;
* 3D printing machine; 
* Welding machine;

### About

This project was developed at the International Iberian Nanotechnology Laboratory by Ricardo Cardoso and supervised by Miguel Xavier,Ph.D. and researcher at INL. 
The main inspiration for this project was the [DropletKitchen's solution](https://dropletkitchen.github.io/index.html). Please go and review their project as a lot of information is complementary to this one!
