# MicroLab
The Microlab project describes how to build a simple and inexpensive system for the opperation of microfluidic devices. The system consists of four syringe pumps and a microscope. To opperate this peripherals, software was also developed. 

## System Overview

The system consists of:
* [Syringe Pump](Microlab/SyringePump) 
* [Microscope](https://github.com/RicardoMarquesCardoso/MicroLab/tree/main/Microscope) 
* [Software](Microlab/Software) 

**The peripherals were developed using 3D printing techniques and laser cutting. Both methods are required in order to build the system**

## About

This project was developed by me, Ricardo Cardoso, in collaboration with the International Iberian Nanotechnology Laboratory for my master thesis in Biomedical Engineering at the University of Porto .

This project is inspired in solutions developed by [Martin Fischlechner, Jonathan West and Klaus-Peter Zauner](https://dropletkitchen.github.io/pages/projects.html) and by [Patcherlab](https://pachterlab.github.io/poseidon/).
