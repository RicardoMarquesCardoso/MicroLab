# MicroLab
"This" project describes how to build a simple and inexpensive system for the opperation of microfluidic devices. The system consists of four syringe pumps and a microscope. To opperate this peripherals, software was also developed. 

## System Overview 

<p align="center">

</p>

The system consists of:
* [Syringe Pump](Microlab/SyringePump) 
* [Microscope](Microlab/Microscope) 
* [Software](Microlab/Software) 

**The peripherals were developed using 3D printing techniques and laser cutting. Both methods are required in order to build the system**

## About

My name is Ricardo Nuno MarquÃªs Cardoso and this project was developed for my master thesis in Biomedical Engineering at the University of Porto and was developed in collaboration with the International Iberian Nanotechnology Laboratory.

This project is inspired in solutions developed by [Martin Fischlechner, Jonathan West and Klaus-Peter Zauner](https://dropletkitchen.github.io/pages/projects.html) and by [Patcherlab](https://pachterlab.github.io/poseidon/).
