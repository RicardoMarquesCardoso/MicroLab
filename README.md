# MicroLab
"This" project describes how to build a simple and inexpensive system for the opperation of microfluidic devices. The system consists of four syringe pumps and a microscope. To opperate this peripherals, software was also developed. 

## System Overview 





This project is inspired in solutions developed by [Martin Fischlechner, Jonathan West and Klaus-Peter Zauner](https://dropletkitchen.github.io/pages/projects.html) and by [Patcherlab](https://pachterlab.github.io/poseidon/). 

This project is related to my master thesis in Biomedical Engineering at the University of Porto and was developed in collaboration with the International Iberian Nanotechnology Laboratory.
